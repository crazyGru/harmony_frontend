  'Accuracy: Harmony (in its beta) assesses only your facial proportions, angles, and the relative positioning of features. It does not consider factors like hair color, eye color, skin health, and eye contrast, which can all influence facial attractiveness.You can adjust your score accordingly based on those other factors. For example, if you have severe acne, your overall facial attractiveness may be lower than your harmony score. Consider  facial harmony as the foundation of beauty, upon which the rest of your features sit.',
  'Premium users are allowed up to five saved report profiles at once. You can also download your report in .xls format.',
  'Side profile analysis is only available for Premium users.',
  'Your front score is not entirely separable from your side score; both interact with one another. For instance, facial thirds affect the appearance of your side profile. Your jawâ€™s projection in the side profile also influences how your jawline appears in the front profile. Therefore, your front harmony score alone does not fully represent how harmonious your front profile is.',

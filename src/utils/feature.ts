        advice: `To improve your facial convexity, we want to try and improve the balance in projection of your facial thirds. This is primarily done through altering the position of the upper jaw (maxilla) and lower jaw (mandible). 
        Consulting an orthodontist or maxillofacial surgeon is the best bet as the course of action would depend on the severity of your case. Some options are:
        1) Orthognathic surgery to forcibly alter the position of your upper/lower jaw to be in better alignment. This is more financially costly and invasive. This would be appropriate in cases of severe malocclusion.
        2) braces may be the only thing needed to align your jaw.
        3) other orthodontic contraptions can set your teeth in proper alignment.
        4) facial hair around the chin can improve perceived chin projection, which can increase this angle into the harmonious range.
        5) Brow implants if the glabella position is recessed can increase facial convexity.
        6) Multiple-implant augmentation of the midface skeleton can simulate the visual appearance of Le Fort III osteotomy and advancement without altering dental occlusion. The entire midface is freed in the subperiosteal plane. The midface skeleton is augmented with a combination of porous polyethylene implants immobilized.
        A precise course of action would require consulting a specialist and taking X-rays beforehand in the case of jaw surgery.`,

        advice: `Along with correcting any malocclusion (reference facial convexity glabella), there are a few ways to improve your nasomental angle. The best course of action would depend on the specifics of your case:
        1) Chin implants if your angle is too acute can help increase the angle and boost harmony. Keep in mind this would have to consider other facial assessments as the change does not occur in isolation.
        2) Rhinoplasty can alter your nose shape in a specific way to either increase or reduce this angle. One such example would be reducing your nasal projection, which tends to increase the angle and vice versa. 
        This angle is the same conceptually as the nasofacial, but the angles vary inversely.`,

        advice: `While extremely difficult to change the actual underlying morphology of your eyes, there are a few ways to improve this assessment:
        1) Lose body-fat to create a thinner face, thereby increasing your ESR and making your eyes appear wider set. The opposite also holds true -- if you have overly wide set eyes, gaining some weight on your face can lead to the appearance of more normally spaced eyes.
        2) Hairstyles to alter your perceived facial width. Along the same lines as facial fat, you can play around with hairstyles that add width to your face or reduce it. For example, if you have extremely wide set eyes, longer hairstyles that cover the sides of your face or add width can improve your perceived facial harmony. If your eyes are closer set, shorter hairstyles with shorter sides may suit your face better.
        3) Cheekbone implants to increase the width of your face. Or, zygomatic reduction surgery to do the opposite. 
        Overall, the only thing you can do is alter your facial width, but not the actual spacing of your eyes themselves. Craniofacial surgery can be used to correct severe cases of facial deformity, but it is not typically used to make minor corrections to eye spacing.`,

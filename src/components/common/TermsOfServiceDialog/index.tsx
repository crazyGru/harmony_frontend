            No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms
            shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or
            condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
            failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall
            not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

          <p>
            If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
            competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for
            any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the
            minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will
            continue in full force and effect.
